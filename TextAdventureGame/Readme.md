# Overview
What I am currently creating demonstrates two very important applications. I am using the C# language along with Microsoft Forms Application to create a text-like game that seemingly takes place in a terminal of some sort of system called "Echo Systems". There is no story yet but what I had in mind was the main character (you) lost your memories of who you are, the system does not seem to recognize who you are, but you come in contact with a select few from curious places. Some seem to want to help us escape the system and some seem to want to trap us in the system, but in the end, you were never talking to anyone real, but "echoes" of existing people. Their minds were uploaded into this system, essentially trapping them. 

I wanted to create something that I can show off. Something from my own mind and creativity and i've seen a few terminal based text games and I wanted to give it a spin on what I could accomplish or change about this sort of game. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Create the actual game / story
- Add sound effects to minor things, like buttons or typing
- More Organization. Better classes and maybe create an "intro" "start" "middle" "end" portion to indicate what part of the game you're in.
